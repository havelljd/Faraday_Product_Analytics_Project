# Faraday_Product_Analytics_Project

# ***NOTE***

This was a school project. This code was largely produced as a class, not independently by me. While I do understand each section of the code (and did individual assignments following the sections along the way), I didn't write all of this myself. I did some cleaning of the code and published it here, primarily to show how I got the data sources for this <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffrey.havell/viz/Faraday_Strategy_Case/FaradayDashboard?publish=yes" target="_blank">Tableau dashboard</a> I created to display these analytics. 

# Problem / Question

A fictional manufacturing company, Faraday, needs to know if they should pursue producing one of three separate products. Using two different data sources (hupspot data and some data queried out of a local database), collect the correct data and run analytics to determine which products (if any) Faraday should pursue.
